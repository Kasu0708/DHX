<h2 id="1-ülevaade">1 Overview</h2>

<h3 id="11-protokolli-käsitlusala">1.1 Scope of the protocol</h3>

<p>Document exchange protocol DHX is a standardised technical and organisational solution, enabling institutions to exchange documents, based on a distributed or decentralised principle.</p>

<p>DHX enables the decentralised organisation of electronic document exchange, without the need for a central post-processing unit. Unlike the old document exchange centre (DEC), DHX does not require visiting “the post office” any longer from document management systems (DMS), but ensures the transmission of documents directly from the sender to the recipient.</p>

<p>The protocol does not require individual (bilateral) agreements, configurations, building of interfaces, etc. between institutions that exchange documents. An institution following the protocol may send a document to another institution without previous communication between the two institutions.</p>

<p>DHX is intended mainly for the safe and cost-efficient organisation of the public sector’s document exchange, but the scheme can also be expanded to organisations of private and free sectors.</p>

<p>DHX supports the mediation of a data service (within the meaning of X-Road).</p>

<p>DHX uses the X-Road infrastructure.</p>

<p>The protocol presumes the motivation of the implementing parties for the efficient and safe organisation of document exchange: will of the sender to send documents, and will of the recipient to receive documents.</p>

<h3 id="12-dokumendi-eesmärk">1.2 Objective of the document</h3>

<p>This document specifies the conformity requirements, data formats, the processing and procedural logic for all parties related to the implementation of DHX – institutions implementing DHX, the intermediaries of DHX and the X-Road Centre. It also covers transition from the former DEC-based document exchange to the use of DHX.</p>

<h3 id="13-väljatöötamine">1.3 Development</h3>

<p>The compilation of the protocol is based on the best practice in protocol specification [RIA-PP].</p>

<p>The protocol has been designed as an open standard.</p>

<div class="note">Note (informative). <br>
The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF ([RFC 6852]) has set the following criteria for an open standard: <br>
- due process: <br>
  - decisions are made with equity and fairness among participants <br>
  - the standards process is transparent <br>
    - record of discussions <br>
    - public comment period is provided before final approval and adoption <br>
    - processes for periodic review and updating are well defined <br>
- broad consensus <br>
- transparency <br>
- balance – standardisation activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group <br>
- voluntary adoption. IETF has the opinion that success of a standard is determined by the market.</div>

<p>The protocol has been developed by the Information System Authority.</p>

<p>Proposals and recommendations submitted in the report of the analysis conducted in May–June 2016 within the framework of the project „Development of transfer of the document exchange infrastructure to a distributed architecture“ (performed by BPW Consulting OÜ) have been taken into account in the protocol. </p>

<p>Please send any proposals and comments to help@ria.ee or create <code>Issue</code> in this repository.</p>

<p>The protocol can be used with the MIT licence [MIT].</p>

<p>To verify the quality and feasibility of the protocol, <a href='https://dhxdemo.eesti.ee/'>a reference implementation</a> has been developed.</p>

<p>Working documents and background information from the protocol development process can  be accessed at <a href='https://github.com/e-gov/DHX'>https://github.com/e-gov/DHX</a>.</p>

<h3 id="14-disaini-kaalutlused">1.4 Design aspects</h3>

<p>The protocol has been designed based on the business requirements set to a distributed document exchange solution:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>distribution</strong> - the solution may not require a central node or any other central components, except options offered by the X-Road infrastructure (the X-Road identification and addressing system, X-Road meta services).</li>
<li><strong>deliverability</strong> - the solution must enable guaranteed delivery of documents to all institutions using X-Road, who adopt DHX.</li>
<li><strong>addressability</strong> - a sender must be able, based on the name of the addressee, to find easily the address, where to send the document.</li>
<li><strong>security</strong> - a sent document must reach the correct addressee and only them.</li>
<li><strong>fast</strong> - time of delivery of the document must be short, not longer than in a DEC solution.</li>
<li><strong>legal</strong> - the solution must meet valid legislation, or realistic proposals are submitted for amending the law.</li>
<li><strong>simple</strong> - the technical implementation must be simple, any development tasks required in DMSs must be performed at a minimum cost.</li>
<li><strong>low operation costs</strong> - the solution may not set an additional system administration burden to DMS administrators.</li>
<li><strong>enabling the traffic of e-invoices</strong> - the solution must retain similar e-invoice processing possibilities as the former DEC.</li>
<li><strong>agnostic against the document type</strong> - the protocol may not set restrictions on the type of exchanged documents, except on the use of the document exchange “capsule“ (see [DHX]).</li>
<li><strong>minimal</strong> - the protocol may not include elements with low significance for the fulfilment of business requirements.</li>
<li><strong>base layer capacity</strong> - it must be possible to establish further agreements on the protocol.</li>
<li><strong>supporting X-Road version 6</strong> - the protocol must function in X-Road version 6; support of former versions of X-Road is not required.</li>
<li><strong>smooth transition</strong> - the transition to a distributed solution must be planned from a technical as well as organisational point of view; the transition must be smooth; transition risks must be managed with relevant measures.</li>
<li><strong>satisfaction of statistical need</strong> - the information needs of various users of the statistics of the document exchange must be taken into account.</li>
<li><strong>preservation of convenience</strong> - the current convenience of use of DEC for the user must be preserved (may improve) during the use of DHX and the transition period.</li>
</ul>

<p>A balanced solution is sought in the case of conflicting business requirements. </p>

<h3 id="15-laiendatavus">1.5 Extensibility</h3>

<div class='note'>
<p>Note (informal). Development of the protocol aims to create a stable, long-term solution to concrete, important business needs. Nevertheless, possible change of the business needs and also change in substrata of the protocol (X-Road, document exchange capsule) in the future has to be accounted for. Also, one has to consider that protocol users may have special requirements that cannot be met with general rules, but what can be solved with local agreements by narrower user groups. Therefore, the established good practice is to offer extension mechanisms in data exchange protocols. (see, e.g. [HTML5]).</p>
</div>

<p>DHX protocol supports extendability by stipulating one extendability principle and two specific mechanisms:</p>

<p><strong>Principle of layering</strong>. Consciously have been avoided solving problems that can be solved more suitably in some other layer of the protocol stack. Also, dependencies from adjoining layers have tried to be minimised - by using only these elements of adjoining layers the use of which is justified.</p>

<p><strong>Versioning</strong>. We foresee the possibility that the protocol will be amended or updated in future. Amending must be very infrequent and strongly justified. To allow amending, the protocol is versioned. Semantic versioning pattern [SEMVER] is used. The first officially published version is 1.0.</p>

<p class="advisement">The system that sends the document MUST specify the version of the DHX protocol used.</p>

<p><strong>User-specific elements in messages</strong>. Protocol offers a mechanism for using additional parameters both in query message that sends the document, and in the response message. For specifics see specification of service  <code>sendDocument</code> in Appendix 1.</p>

<h2 id="2-nõuete-keel">2 Language of requirements</h2>

<p>This text, including the appendices, has a normative meaning, except the sections with the note “informative”. The other content of theGitHub repository has an informative meaning.</p>

<p>Words in capital letters must be interpreted as follows (see [RFC 2119]):</p>

“MUST”, “MAY ONLY” – the implementer of the protocol cannot declare conformity to the protocol if the requirement is not fulfilled.
“SHOULD” – the requirement must not necessarily be implemented, but the implementation can be considered conforming to the protocol only if there is a sound reason for deviation from the fulfilment of the requirement.
“MAY” – a property may be implemented; non-implementation need not be explained.

<h2 id="4-lähteolukord">4 Initial situation</h2>

<p>Currently, DMSs exchange documents via DEC, by using the tentatively named “DEC protocol”. The “DEC protocol” is determined by the list of electronic data exchange meta data [Capsule], the specification of DEC interfaces [DEC specification ] and [DEC maintenance procedure], and, in a broader context, “Common Principles of Administrative and Records Management Procedures” [AÜK]. To a smaller degree, document exchange interfaces have also been established between other information systems that process documents. These interfaces have not been standardised. The extending document circulation and the tightening network of information systems that exchange documents (modern document exchange is not limited to the so-called pure DMSs – documents are also exchanged by information systems, where document management in the traditional meaning is simply one type of data processing) call for an alternative to the document circulation occurring via a central mailbox server.</p>

<p><img src="DHX-ASIS-EN.PNG" alt="" title=""></p>

<p>Figure 1. Initial situation: document exchange via DEC</p>

<h2 id="5-dhx-teenus">5 DHX service</h2>

<h3 id="51-üldiseloomustus">5.1 General description</h3>

<p>The DHX service is an X-Road service with a standard name pattern and processing logic, enabling an institution to send documents to another institution.</p>

<p><img src="DHX-TOBE-EN.PNG" alt="" title=""></p>

<p>Figure 2. Basic scheme of DHX</p>

<p>The use of the DHX service is an interaction, where two messages are sent: <br>
 - the sender of the document sends an X-Road query message (query) to the service sendDocument <br>
 - the receiver of the document sends a response message, confirming the receipt of the document.</p>

<div class="note">Note. Query and response messages form a synchronous <em>request-response</em> message pair used as a standard on X-Road.  </div>

<p>If a document has been incorrectly addressed or formed, a relevant error message is sent in the response message.</p>

<p>A document is transmitted in the query message.</p>

<p>Documents are transmitted with the push method. The sender of the document initiates sending by addressing the <code>sendDocument</code> service of the addressee.</p>

<h3 id="52-dhx-teenuse-väljaarendamine">5.2 Development of the DHX service</h3>

<p class="advisement">An institution implementing DHX (or their DMS mediation service or DMS accommodation service provider) MUST develop the DHX service in their DMS and operate it.</p>

<p>The protocol does not exclude situations, where only a sending or receiving capability meeting the requirements of DHX protocol is established in DMS. Technically, there are no constraints. As the business need of such asymmetric solutions is unclear, proceeding from the objective to maintain simplicity, the protocol does not specify separate profiles for the systems limited to sending or reception.</p>

<p class="advisement">Institution implementing DHX CAN build DHX capability into more than one of its information systems.</p>

<p class="advisement">DHX service performed by a DHX implementer MUST meet the detailed specification provided in Appendix 1.</p>

<h3 id="53-dhx-teenuse-avamine">5.3 Opening a DHX service</h3>

<p class="advisement">An institution implementing DHX MUST open the DHX service to all institutions with whom they want to exchange documents. If an institution does not want to open a DHX service to all members of X-Road due to security policy or other reasons, they MAY open a DHX service to specific members of X-Road (with granting access rights in the X-Road security server).</p>

<p>DHX is intended primarily as a universal document exchange agreement.</p>

<p class="advisement">For the transition period, DHX service MUST be opened also to DEC.</p>

<p>DEC transmits documents from institutions who have not yet established DHX capability.</p>

<h3 id="54-nimemuster">5.4 Name pattern</h3>

<p class="advisement">The name of the DHX service MUST follow the pattern <code>EE/&lt;member class&gt;/&lt;registry code&gt;/&lt;DHX*&gt;/sendDocument</code>, wheres<br>
 - <code>EE</code> is the name of the Estonian X-Road instance; <br>
 - <code>&lt;member class&gt;</code> is the member class of X-Road (depending on the legal form of the intermediary, either <code>GOV</code> or <code>PRI</code>);<br>
 - <code>&lt;DHX*&gt;</code> is the name of the X-Road subsystem ensuring detection of the service, fixed with this protocol in form <code>DHX*</code>, i.e. three inital symbols of the name MUST be <code>DHX</code>. Fixed initial symbols MAY be followed by more symbols, i.e. name MUST begin with <code>DHX</code>, but CAN be longer. If institution employes DHX only in one information system (in institution's DMS), then <code>DHX</code> is sufficient for X-Road subsystem name. However, if institution wants to employ DHX in more that ine information system., then different sybsystem names MUST be chosen.<br>
 - <code>&lt;registrikood&gt;</code> is the registry code of the institution.</p>

<div class="example">Examples:<br>
 <code>EE/GOV/70003158/DHX/sendDocument</code><br>
 <code>EE/GOV/70000906/DHX.viru/sendDocument</code> (Viru Regional Prosecutor's Office)<br>
 <code>EE/GOV/70000906/DHX.laane/sendDocument</code> (Lääne Regional Prosecutor's Office)<br>
 (Regional Prosecutor's Offices are not independent institutions but subunits of  Prosecutor's Office.)
</div>

<h3 id="55-reserveeritud-nimi-dhx">5.5 Reserved name DHX*</h3>

<p class="advisement">DHX service MUST use the X-Road subsystem name <code>DHX*</code>, where <code>*</code> is a sequence of symbols that can be empty. The X-Road Centre MAY NOT register the subsystem “DHX” of any institution for another purpose</p>

<p class="advisement">If institution employs DHX only in one of its information systems (in institution's DMS), then X-Road subsystem name code>DHX</code> SHOULD be used (and not a longer name).</p>

<div class='note'>
  <p>Note (informative). Information system may provide services other than DHX document exchange under subsystem name <code>DHX*</code>. Nevertheless, wider use of the name DHX can cause a need for unnecessary communication or even confusion. Therefore, if information system has besides DHX protocol data traffic other data traffic in X-Road, then it can be suitable to bind more than one X-Road subsystem to the information system.</p>
  <p>For example, figure 3a represents an information system - <code>ADIT</code> - that is bound to two X-Road subsystems: 1) DHX data traffic flows through <code>DHX-ADIT</code>; 2) other X-Road services are provided and consumed through <code>ADIT</code>.</p>
  <p>Usage of multiple subsystems does not cause additional costs (no separate sertificates are needed). Subsystems can be viewed as logical access points or gates.</p>
</div>  

<p><img src="DHX-Multiple-EN.PNG" alt="" title=""></p>

<p>Figure 3a Use of multiple subsystems</p>

<h3 id="56-kapsli-kasutamine">5.6 Use of capsule</h3>

<p class="advisement">Document MUST be transmitted in a “capsule” complying with the officially confirmed list of digital data exchange metadata [Capsule].</p>

<p>The registry code of the addressee-institution is also forwarded in the capsule of the document.</p>

<h3 id="57-unikaalne-identifikaator">5.7 Unique identifier</h3>

<p class="advisement">The sending system MUST assign a unique identifier to the series of attempts to send document (<code>consignment id</code>). (See also Section 7.7 Re-attempting).</p>

<h2 id="6-vahendamine">6 Mediation</h2>

<h3 id="61-vahendamise-mõiste">6.1 Definition of mediation</h3>

<p>In the case of mediation, an intermediary provides the service of sending and receiving documents on X-Road to an institution. The institution does not communicate with X-Road in the DHX context themselves. The institution even need not to be an X-Road member. The intermediary uses their name on X-Road. An intermediary may be a company of private sector as well as an institution of public sector.</p>

<p><strong>An institution MAY implement DHX directly (i.e. independently) or via an intermediary</strong></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Note (informative). Mediation differs from accommodation. Many institutions accommodate their DMSs at the providers of accommodation and cloud services. Accommodation may cover the accommodation of the X-Road security server as well as DMS (provision of cloud service). From the standpoint of DHX, it is important whether DMS of an institution communicates on X-Road using the X-Road certificate of the institution or not. All relationships, where communication on X-Road takes place with the X-Road certificate of the service provider instead of the X-Road certificate of the institution, are considered mediation.</p>

  <p>In the case of accommodation, fulfilment of the requirements of this protocol must be ensured the upon implementation of DHX. The method depends on the specific relationship between the accommodation service provider and the institution, and is not covered by the scope of this protocol.</p>
</div>

<p>Upon the mediation of DHX, an intermediary develops the DHX service, opens it to other institutions and then operates it. Figure 3 includes the scheme of interaction principles in the case of mediation.</p>

<p><img src="DHX-Mediation-EN.PNG" alt="" title=""></p>

<p>Figure 3 Mediation of DHX service</p>

<p>Requirements proceeding from the X-Road regulation are set to mediation: obligation to register on X-Road as an intermediary, obligation to develop and publish the procedure (policy) for data service mediation, etc. (see [X-Road regulation] § 13).</p>

<h3 id="62-vahendajate-nimekiri">6.2 List of intermediaries</h3>

<p class="advisement">Upon the implementation of DHX via an intermediary, the institution MUST conclude a contract with the DHX intermediary. They MAY ONLY use the intermediaries entered into the list of DHX intermediaries by the X-Road Centre.</p>

<p>The list of intermediaries is the list of intermediaries of the DHX document exchange service.</p>

<p>The list of intermediaries is maintained by the X-Road Centre (RIA).</p>

<p>Technically the list of intermediaries is executed as a DHX intermediary group. DHX intermediary group is part of the X-Road global configuration. As such, the list of intermediaries is available to all X-Road members. </p>

<p class="advisement">An institution or a company intending to operate as an intermediary MUST register themselves on X-Road as intermediaries. Specific registration procedure is established by the X-Road Centre.</p>

<p class="advisement">The X-Road Centre MUST maintain an updated list of DHX intermediaries.</p>

<h3 id="63-vahendusnimekiri">6.3 Mediation list</h3>

<p>The mediation list is a list of institutions mediated by an intermediary and maintained by an intermediary.</p>

<p class="advisement">An intermediary MUST maintain mediation list.</p>

<p class="advisement">Vahendaja PEAB hoidma vahendusnimekirja autentsena ja ajakohasena.</p>

<p>An intermediary MUST keep the mediation list authentic and updated. Authenticity means that the mediation list must present mediation relationships correctly and completely. Updating means that the mediation list must present all valid mediation relationships at every given moment.</p>

<p>The mediation list MAY include information about expired or future mediation relationships (presented with fields <code>startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code>).</p>

<p class="advisement">An intermediary MUST make the mediation list available as an X-Road service.</p>

<p class="advisement">The name of the mediation list service MUST follow the pattern  <code>EE/&lt;member class&gt;/&lt;registry code&gt;/DHX/representationList</code>, where <br>
 - <code>EE</code> is the name of the Estonian X-Road instance <br>
 - <code>&lt;liikmeklass&gt;</code> is a member class of X-Road (value according to X-Road protocol – depending on the legal form of intermediary, either <code>GOV</code>, <code>COM</code>, <code>NGO</code> or <code>NEE</code>)  <br>
 - <code>DHX</code> is the name of X-Road subsystem ensuring the detection of the service, fixed with this protocol, and <br>
 - <code>&lt;registrikood&gt;</code> is the registry code of the institution.</p>

<p>Example: <code>EE/COM/40001111/DHX/representationList</code></p>

<p class="advisement">The mediation list service provided by a DHX implementer MUST meet the detailed specification provided in Appendix 2.</p>

<h2 id="7-saatmine">7 Sending</h2>

<h3 id="71-dhx-võimekus">7.1 DHX capability</h3>

<p class="advisement">The sending system MUST find out if the adressee has DHX capability.</p>

<p>DHX capability may be a direct capability or capability through an intermediary.</p>

<div class="note">Note (informative). It possible to speak more specifically of <em>DHX sending capability</em> and <em>DHX reception capability</em>. DHX does not require symmetrical implementation: there are no technical restrictions to the establishment of only sending DMS or only receiving DMS. However, the use case of such solutions is not clear. Setting the requirement of symmetrical capability is an administrative decision and remains outside the scope of this protocol. The protocol presumes that when choosing the extent of implementation of the protocol, parties proceed from real need to send and receive documents.</div>

<h3 id="72-otsevõimekuse-väljaselgitamine">7.2 Identification of direct capability</h3>

<p class="advisement">Direct capability MUST be identified as a first priority (before the identification of capability through an intermediary).</p>

<p class="advisement">The sending system SHOULD determine direct capability, based on the global configuration file of X-Road.</p>

<p>The availability of the DHX subsystem in the institution is the marker of direct capability.</p>

<p>The global configuration MAY BE downloaded from the X-Road Centre, or the global configuration file downloaded by the X-Road security server, offered by the security server interface, MAY BE used.</p>

<p>If the sending system considers the identification of DHX direct capability based on the global configuration file of X-Road technically too complicated, direct capability MAY BE also checked with a direct sending attempt.</p>

<p>If the security server answers that the addressee does not have a DHX subsystem, it can be concluded that the addressee is lacking DHX direct capability.</p>

<p>The security server of the sender downloads periodically information about the X-Road configuration from the X-Road central server [PR-GCONF], including information about the subsystems and security servers specified by the X-Road members. Based on this configuration information, security server of the sender determines whether the addressee has specified the DHX subsystem. If not, then DHX capability is lacking.</p>

<p class="advisement">If the addressee has direct capability, the document MUST BE sent directly to the addressee.</p>

<h3 id="73-võimekus-läbi-vahendaja">7.3 Capability through intermediary</h3>

<p class="advisement">When direct capability is lacking, the sending system MUST check whether the addressee has DHX capability through an intermediary.</p>

<p class="advisement">In order to check DHX capability through an intermediary, the sending system MUST:<br>
 - download the X-Road global configuration file from the X-Road Centre or use the global configuration file downloaded by the security server; <br>
 - find the list of intermediaries in the file (DHX intermediary group); <br>
 - check all intermediaries and request mediation lists via X-Road; <br>
 - find out whether the addressee is included in the mediation lists; <br>
 - check the validity of mediation relationship (with fields <code>startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> of the response message of the service <code>representationList</code>).</p>

<p class="advisement">If the addressee has no DHX direct capability, but has DHX capability through an intermediary, the sending system MUST send the document to the intermediary.</p>

<h3 id="74-lokaalne-aadressiraamat">7.4 Local address book</h3>

<p class="advisement">The sending system MAY buffer the result of identification of DHX capability, forming a so-called local address book. It MUST be possible to configure the updating period of the buffer (local address book).</p>

<h3 id="75-saatmine-dvk-sse">7.5 (void)</h3>

<h3 id="76-dokumendi-lugemine-edastatuks">7.6 Considering a transmitted document</h3>

<p class="advisement">The sending system MUST consider the transmitted document, when the response message with a positive response code has been received from the <code>sendDocument</code> service.</p>

<p>A confirmation of receipt of the document is sent in the response message of a <em>request</em>-<em>response</em> message pair of X-Road. If the parties need confirmations of higher level business logic layer, these can be realised outside the DHX protocol or as cover layer of DHX protocol.</p>

<h3 id="77-uuesti-üritamine">7.7 Re-attempting</h3>

<p class="advisement">If contact is not established with the addressee or no confirmation of receipt is received, sending MUST BE attempted again after some time.</p>

<div class="note">ote (informative). When performing re-sending, the logic used in DMSs interfaced with DEC can be taken as a comparison.</div>

<p class="advisement">In order to minimise the number of void queries, the exponential back-off algorithm [EXP] SHOULD be used.</p>

<p class="advisement">The number of sending attempts MUST be finite and possible to determine in the configuration of the sending system.</p>

<h3 id="78-saatmisalgoritm-informatiivne">7.8 Sending algorithm (informative)</h3>

<p>The following sending algorithm illustrates a possible way of performing the sending of a document programmatically. The constructions of Go language [GOLANG] have been used in the algorithm. The algorithm has an informative meaning. The implementer of the protocol may fulfil the sending requirements in a way chosen by themselves. The algorithm does not cover the preparation of a capsule.</p>

<ul>
<li>Function <code>adresseeHasDirectDHXCapability</code> finds out, using X-Road global configuration, whether institution <code>a</code> has DHX direct capability.</li>
<li>Function <code>adresseeUsesIntermediary</code> finds out, using X-Road group <code>DHX intermediaries</code> and X-Road services <code>representationList</code> of the intermediaries, whether institution <code>a</code> uses DHX intermediary.</li>

<h2 id="8-vastuvõtmine">8 Receiving</h2>

<h3 id="81-aadressi-kontroll">8.1 Address check</h3>

<p class="advisement">The receiving system MUST check that the document has been sent to the correct address.</p>

<p class="advisement">In the case of mediation, the receiving system MUST check whether the addressee is a customer of the intermediary (entered into the mediation list).</p>

<h3 id="82-valest-aadressist-teatamine">8.2 Notification of a wrong address</h3>

<p class="advisement">In the case of an incorrectly addressed document, the receiving system MUST send error message <code>Wrong address</code> to the sender.</p>

<h3 id="83-kapsli-kontroll">8.3 Capsule check</h3>

<p class="advisement">The receiving system MUST check that document has arrived in a proper capsule. The check MUST include at least checking the compliance with the XML scheme. In the case of a defective capsule, a relevant error message <code>Defective capsule</code> MUST be sent.</p>

<p>The receiving system MAY perform additional checks on semantic or business logical level.</p>

<h3 id="84-mitme-aadressi-käsitlus">8.4 Handling multiple addresses</h3>

<p class="advisement">If sender DMS wants to send a document to multiple adressees (institutions with direct DHX capability or represented institutions), then it MUST send the document to each addressee separately, by separate DHX <code>sendDocument</code> service invocation.</p>

<p class="note">Note (informative). In sending the capsule, only parameters <code>memberCode</code> and <code>recipient</code> of the DHX <code>sendDocument</code> service are used for addressing. Additional adressees defined in the capsule are only of informative value in sending the DHX document (similar to CC field in a received e-mail message). Sending DMS must not presume that adressee of direct DHX capability will pass on the message to other adressees specified in the capsule. Mediator is responsible only for delivery of the capsule to addressee that is specified in <code>recipient</code> element of the <code>sendDocument</code> service. Mediator is not responsible for delivery of the message to other adressees that are specified in the capsule.</p>

<h3 id="85-vastuvõtmine-dvk-st">8.5 Reception from DEC</h3>

<p class="advisement">In a transition period, a system having established DHX capability MUST receive documents also from DEC.</p>

<p>Technically this means that the system having transferred to DHX must open their DHX service also to DEC. DEC transmits documents from the institutions who have not yet transferred to DHX.</p>

<h3 id="86-saatja-kindlakstegemine">8.6 Identification of sender</h3>

<p>Sender of the document can be identified in two ways: 1) using metadata describing the sender, included in the document capsule; 2) using X-Road header fields <code>client</code> [PR-MESS] and <code>representedParty</code> [X-EXT] of X-Road query message.</p>

<div class="note">Note (informative). Pursuant to the extension of representation of a third party of X-Road message protocol, the intermediary must specify the institution they represent in the X-Road message header, in the field <code>representedParty</code> [X-EXT].</div>

<p class="advisement">The receiving system MUST check the consistency of metadata describing the sender included in the document capsule and X-Road header fields <code>client</code> and <code>representedParty</code> of X-Road query message. In the case of discrepancies, the document MUST be rejected.</p>

<p class="advisement">Upon the receipt of a document from an intermediary it MUST be checked whether the intermediary has been entered into the list of intermediaries. Check result MAY be buffered.</p>

<h2 id="9-üleminek">9 Transition</h2>

<h3 id="91-üleminekuperiood">9.1 Transition period</h3>

<p>Transition to the DHX protocol takes place in a predetermined period of time. The transition period will start for all institutions simultaneously. The X-Road Centre will announce the beginning of the period. The transition period will end with the termination of DEC operations.</p>

<p>In the transition period, institutions will develop in their DMSs the capability to send and receive documents under the DHX protocol. In technical terms, “DHX capability” refers to the provision of the X-Road service under the DHX protocol and the capability to connect to an equivalent service of other institutions</p>

<p>DHX capability does not emerge simultaneously in institutions, because developments are completed at different times. Figure 4 explains co-functioning of the systems transferred and not yet transferred to DHX in the transition period.</p>

<p><img src="DHX-TRANSITION-EN-03.PNG" alt="" title=""></p>

<p>Figure 4. Functioning in the transition period</p>

<p>Institutions 1 and 2 have transferred to the DHX protocol and exchange mutually documents directly via DHX. Institution 3 is still using the old “DEC protocol”.</p>

<p>In the transition period, DEC performs the function of a translator between the new and old protocols (DHX and DEC), operating as a DHX mediator - for these DEC clients who have neither attained DHX direct capability yet nor chosen another DHX mediator.</p>

<p>DHX Adapter is the “universal software component” developed by RIA, the objective of which is to simplify the re-tuning of DMSs to the use of DHX. The use of DHX Adapter is not obligatory.</p>

<p class="advisement">In the transition period, as soon as the DMS of an institution has developed the DHX capability (when the development is finished), the institution MUST start, at the earliest opportunity, using the DHX service for sending documents.</p>

<p class="advisement">If it turns out in the transition period that the addressee has not created a DHX service for receiving documents (i.e. the service cannot be found on X-Road), then the document MUST BE sent via DEC by using the DEC service <code>sendDocument</code> and marking the addressee in the capsule of metadata of the document.</p>

<p class="advisement">An institution having achieved DHX capability MUST quit using DEC.</p>

<h3 id="92-dvk-toimimine-üleminekuperioodil">9.2 Functioning of DEC in the transition period</h3>

<p>DEC will be kept in operation throughout the whole transition period. DEC will be implemented with necessary functionality, so it would be operational during the transition period.</p>

<p>DEC provides the service <code>sendDocument</code>, which the institution that has created the DHX capability can use to forward the document to an institution that has not yet established the DHX capability. The forwarding is performed by DEC.</p>

<p>In the transition period, DEC will function as a DHX service intermediary (RIA will be added to the list of intermediaries).</p>

<p>DEC will publish a list of clients (representees) served during the transition period, according to this protocol (by <code>representationList</code> service).</p>

<p>In case a document which has been addressed to an institution that has established the DHX capability is received by DEC, DEC will attempt to immediately forward it.</p>

<p>DEC will be switched off when all DEC institutions have established the DHX protocol capability or upon expiration of the term of the transition period.</p>

<h3 id="10-vastavusnõuded">10 Conformance criteria</h3>

<p>This section summarises the conformance criteria (see e.g. RFC 2049), which must be met before a document exchange system can be declared DHX compliant.</p>

<p>The following list is limited to software technical measures and technical parameters of systems ensuring interoperability. Parties and coordinators of document exchange may establish various (additional) organisational measures for organising DHX document exchange. These are not in the scope of the protocol.</p>
